Shared canvas is a square canvas where you and everyone else can scribble away together.

TODO:

- Create a screen where you can see people's individual arts in a list.
- Create a screen where you can see a single person's art, live.
- Move client-side rendering logic to service workers.
- Add a loader UI that shows how many art submissions are being loaded.
