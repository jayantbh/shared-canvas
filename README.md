# Shared Canvas

> Hello everyone, you've been invited to vandalize this wall-space.

Shared canvas is a square canvas where you and everyone else can scribble away together.

TODO:

- Create a screen where you can see people's individual arts in a list.
- Create a screen where you can see a single person's art, live.
- Add a loader UI that shows how many art submissions are being loaded.

# Development

1. Ensure psql is running: `sudo service postgresql start`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn reset-db`
4. `yarn start`
5. Open `localhost:3000` in two different windows (or browsers, one in incognito?), and carry on!
